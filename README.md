# Codesign's Stash of .files

My own set of personal dotfiles

It's been a long time coming but I'm finally uploading my dotfiles to GitHub

After being inspired by various other people who have put their dotfiles repos
online. I figured I would get my dotfiles layout organised and uploaded online.

I have taken inspiration from holman's dotfiles repo where everything is
organised by topic instead of having all files just put in one or more files
and/or folders. This makes it more cleaner and easier to manage for me.
